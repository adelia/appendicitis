I have attached the dataset for the patients. There are 3 spreadsheets. All (n=367), paeds (n=102), and adults (n=265).
 
1. As mentioned previously, could u compare the different kinds of appendicitis (ie normal, acute, suppurative etc as 
listed in column D) and see if there are any significant differences in elevated WCC, elevated neutrophil count and 
elevated CRP count. Even if the results are not significantly statistically, could u kindly let me have the p values?
 
2. Could u kindly do this for each spreadsheet, ie all, paeds, adults?
 
3. Finally, if it is possilbe, could u also compare and see if there are any significant differences in a) the number
of accurate diagnosis of appendicitis by CT (column M) and b) the number of accurate diagnosis of appendicitis by
ultrasound scans (column S). If analysing this area (from columns H to S) is not feasible, then it is ok.
 
4. If you find out anything that is interesting or significantly worth mentioning, pls do feel free to let me know as 
well. You are the expert in this field and I truly value your opinion and suggestions.
